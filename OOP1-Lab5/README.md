# Practical Lab Assignment

1. Write a program to calculate area of a circle using functions.

   area = (atan(1) * 4) * (pow(radius, 2));

   **GET the PI value**

   atan(1) = PI/4 * 4 = PI

   **Pow**

   Use pow function to exponentiation.

2. Write a program to swap two values using functions.
